# Get-ADComputerInfo.ps1
This script will query all of the computer accounts in domains you have access to and output the data to a .CSV file.  This was presented during the Brainstorm 16.0 conference in 2015. I hope this makes you very happy while you 'assess the situation'. Requirements:  Active Directory Module for PowerShell  (Workstations will require the Remote Server Adminstration Tools (RSAT) in order to add the AD module)
